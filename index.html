                        <br>
                        <p>The first human inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago have been traced to the Paleolithic,
                            around 38–39,000 years ago.[1] The Jōmon period, named after its cord-marked pottery, was
                            followed by the Yayoi period in the first millennium BC when new inventions were introduced
                            from Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in
                            the Chinese Book of Han in the first century AD.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Around the 3rd century BC, the Yayoi people from the continent immigrated to the Japanese
                            archipelago and introduced iron technology and agricultural civilization.[2] Because they
                            had an agricultural civilization, the population of the Yayoi began to grow rapidly and
                            ultimately overwhelmed the Jōmon people, natives of the Japanese archipelago who were
                            hunter-gatherers.[3] Between the fourth and ninth centuries, Japan's many kingdoms and
                            tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by
                            the Emperor of Japan. The imperial dynasty established at this time continues to this day,
                            albeit in an almost entirely ceremonial role. In 794, a new imperial capital was established
                            at Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), marking the beginning of the Heian period, which lasted until
                            1185. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical Japanese culture. Japanese
                            religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native Shinto practices and Buddhism.

                            The tourism industry, one of the key industries driving the Japanese economy, is growing
                            rapidly as the number of foreign visitors and inbound consumption increases. While its
                            abundant tourism resources are attracting worldwide attention, labor shortages are an issue,
                            and thus foreign companies are expected to enter the industry.
                            The government is supporting the tourism industry by attracting tourists to regional areas
                            to revitalize regional economies and improve productivity through the introduction of
                            tourism digital transformation (DX). The three government initiatives are introduced below:

                            Japan is a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. A great
                            power and the only Asian member of the G7, Japan has constitutionally renounced its right to
                            declare war, but maintains one of the world's strongest militaries. A highly developed
                            country with one of the world's largest economies, Japan is a global leader in science and
                            technology and the automotive, robotics, and electronics industries. It has one of the
                            world's highest life expectancies, though it is undergoing a population decline. Japan's

                            During the 17th century, a third of the world’s silver was produced in the small town of
                            Omori. The mines were closed down in the 1920s but the surrounding area, dubbed “Iwami
                            Ginzan Silver Mine and its Cultural Landscape” was registered with UNESCO in 2007.

                            Take a relaxing stroll down Omori street past merchant houses from the 1500s that have been
                            converted into cozy cafes. Visiting the perfectly preserved streets and narrow pathway of
                            Ryugenji Mabu Mineshaft will transport you back to Japan’s bygone era of simpler
                            times.You’ve definitely seen the red torii gate of Itsukushima Shrine floating angelically
                            on the ocean if you’ve ever Googled images of Japan. The shrine is located on the tiny
                            island of Miyajima, a 10-minute ferry ride away from the mainland of southern Hiroshima
                            Prefecture.

                            Snap a perfect picture of the grand torii at high tide when it appears to be floating, or
                            walk right up and touch it during low tide. With its hypnotic otherworldly atmosphere at
                            dusk, it’s no wonder the gate is considered the pathway between the human and spirit realm.
